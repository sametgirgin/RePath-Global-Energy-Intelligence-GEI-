### Technical Context for Generation (TWh) and Consumption (Exajoules)

## 1. Nuclear Energy – Generation – TWh (from 1965)

**Definition:**  
Nuclear electricity generation represents the **electrical output produced by nuclear reactors**, expressed in **terawatt-hours (TWh)**.

- **1 TWh = 1 trillion watt-hours (10¹² Wh)**  
- **1 TWh = 3.6 petajoules (PJ)**

Generation reflects the **electricity supplied to the grid**, typically after subtracting the power used internally by the plant (if net generation is reported).

### Technical Notes  
Nuclear generation in TWh indicates:

- Reactor operating capacity  
- Capacity factors (often 70–95%)  
- Number and size of reactors  
- Efficiency of heat-to-power conversion  
- Operational performance and outages  

TWh is the standard measurement for comparing nuclear output with other electricity sources (coal, gas, wind, solar, hydro).

## 2. Nuclear Energy – Consumption – Exajoules (from 1965)

**Definition:**  
In energy statistics, nuclear “consumption” refers to the **primary energy equivalent** of nuclear electricity, expressed in **exajoules (EJ)**.

- **1 EJ = 10¹⁸ joules**  
- **1 EJ ≈ 278 TWh of electricity** (assuming a 33% conversion efficiency)

### Technical Notes  
Nuclear consumption in EJ does *not* indicate uranium fuel usage.  
Instead, it reflects the **thermal energy that would have been required** to generate the same amount of electricity in a typical thermal power plant.

Most agencies (IEA, EI, BP, EIA) use the **thermal equivalent method**, assuming:

> **Primary energy (EJ) = Electricity produced (TWh) ÷ Thermal efficiency**

Example:  
If a plant generates **100 TWh** of electricity:

- Thermal equivalent = 100 TWh ÷ 0.33 ≈ 303 TWh-equivalent  
- In joules: 303 TWh × 3.6 PJ/TWh = **1.09 EJ**

This allows nuclear energy to be compared directly with fossil fuel primary energy metrics.

## 3. Summary Comparison

| Metric | Unit | What It Measures | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------------|---------|
| **Nuclear Generation** | TWh | Electricity produced by reactors | Power-sector analysis and grid comparisons |
| **Nuclear Consumption** | Exajoules (EJ) | Primary energy equivalent of nuclear electricity | Whole-energy-system comparisons with fossil fuels |

## 4. Why Two Units Are Used

- **TWh** captures actual **electricity output**.  
- **EJ** captures **primary energy input equivalent**, enabling comparison with coal, oil, gas, and other fuels in global energy balances.
