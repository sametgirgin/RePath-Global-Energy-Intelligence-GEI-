## What Is an Exajoule?

A **joule (J)** is the basic SI unit of energy, roughly the work needed to lift a small apple a centimeter.

An **exajoule (EJ)** is: **1 EJ = 10¹⁸ joules = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 J**

Engineers use exajoules because global and national energy systems deal in enormous flows that would be unwieldy in smaller units.

## Conversion Table for 1 Exajoule

| Unit | Value in 1 EJ | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| **Joule (J)** | `1 × 10^18` J | Base SI unit |
| **Gigajoule (GJ)** | `1,000,000,000` GJ | Industrial energy scale |
| **Terajoule (TJ)** | `1,000,000` TJ | Comparable to very large lightning energies |
| **Petajoule (PJ)** | `1,000` PJ | Used in regional/national energy statistics |
| **Kilowatt-hours (kWh)** | `≈ 2.78 × 10^11` kWh | Household-scale intuition |
| **Megawatt-hours (MWh)** | `≈ 2.78 × 10^8` MWh | Utility-scale energy |
| **Barrels of oil equivalent (boe)** | `≈ 163,000,000` boe | Common comparison for fuels |
| **Tons of TNT** | `≈ 239,000,000` tons TNT | Explosive-equivalent energy |
| **Natural gas (typical energy content)** | `≈ 28,000,000,000` m³ | Composition-dependent |

## Why Use Exajoules?

Energy analysts, engineers, and policymakers often work with planetary-scale numbers. Exajoules provide a clean, SI-consistent way to compare all energy sources—oil, gas, renewables, nuclear—on equal footing.

If you want to expand this README with energy charts, SI reference sheets, or real-world examples (power plants, national energy mixes, etc.), those sections can be added easily.
