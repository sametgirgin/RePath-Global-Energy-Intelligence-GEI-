### 1. Notes on Proved Oil Reserves Data

This section outlines the data sources, definitions, and methodological considerations relevant to proved oil reserves.

#### 1.1 Sources of Data
Reserves estimates are compiled from:

- **Primary official sources**
- **Third-party datasets**, including:
  - OPEC Secretariat  
  - *World Oil*  
  - *Oil & Gas Journal*  
- **Independent assessments**, including:
  - Russian reserves based on official publications  
  - Chinese reserves derived from official data and publicly available information  
- **Canadian oil sands**: “Under active development” volumes reflect official estimates  
- **Venezuelan Orinoco Belt**: Based on OPEC Secretariat data and government announcements  

Please note that some reserves tables may **not be updated for the latest year**.

---

#### 1.2 Country-Specific Notes
- **Canada**: Includes oil sands in reserves and R/P ratios.  
- **Venezuela**: Includes Orinoco Belt reserves.  
- **Saudi Arabia**: Reserves include NGLs from 2017 onward.  
- **Former USSR**: Includes CIS countries, Georgia, Ukraine, and the Baltic States.
  - Excludes Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania before 1985.  
  - Excludes Croatia and Slovenia before 1990.

#### 1.3 Definitions

##### Total Proved Reserves of Oil
Proved reserves represent:

> Quantities of petroleum that geological and engineering information indicates with reasonable certainty can be recovered in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.

Clarifications:
- These national estimates **may not align** with SEC definitions used by publicly listed companies.
- They are **not necessarily equivalent** to the Energy Institute’s (EI) internal assessments.
- Additional definitions available at:  
  **www.energyinst.org/statistical-review**

Included liquids:
- Crude oil  
- Gas condensate  
- Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs)

---

##### Reserves-to-Production (R/P) Ratio
Defined as:

> **R/P Ratio = Reserves at year-end ÷ Production during that year**

This ratio indicates the theoretical number of years remaining reserves would last **if production remained constant**.

---

#### 1.4 Methodological Notes
- Annual changes and percentage shares use **thousand million barrels (billion barrels)**.
- Data may include both conventional and unconventional liquids where specified.

# 2. Oil Data Series – Technical and Economic Definitions

#### 2.1 Oil: Proved Reserves  
Quantities recoverable with reasonable certainty under current economic and operating conditions.  
Critical for long-term supply outlooks and upstream investment decisions.

---

#### 2.2 Oil: Proved Reserves – Barrels (from 1990)  
Reserves expressed in **barrels**, enabling standardized comparison across countries.

---

#### 2.3 Oil: Production – Barrels (from 1965)  
Total production of crude oil, condensates, and sometimes NGLs.  
A primary driver of global supply and benchmark crude pricing.

---

#### 2.4 Oil: Production – Tonnes (from 1965)  
Production measured in **metric tonnes**, important for mass-based calculations and shipping logistics.

---

#### 2.5 Oil: Crude Oil and Condensate Production – Barrels (from 2000)  
Narrower measure capturing upstream crude and field condensate output.  
Often used for OPEC+ quota assessments.

---

#### 2.6 Oil: Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) Production – Barrels (from 2000)  
Production of ethane, propane, butane, and natural gasoline separated from natural gas streams.

---

#### 2.7 Oil: Total Liquids Consumption – Barrels (from 1965)  
Comprehensive end-use consumption of all liquid fuels, including NGLs and biofuels.

---

#### 2.8 Oil: Consumption – Barrels (from 1965)  
Consumption of refined petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and fuel oil.

---

#### 2.9 Oil: Consumption – Tonnes (from 1965)  
Consumption in metric tonnes, used for mass-based energy balances.

---

#### 2.10 Oil: Consumption – Exajoules (from 1965)  
Energy-equivalent consumption enabling cross-fuel comparison in energy system analysis.

---

#### 2.11 Oil: Regional Consumption – by Product – Barrels (from 1965)  
Breakdown by product categories such as gasoline, diesel, kerosene, LPG, and petrochemical feedstocks.

---

#### 2.12 Oil: Spot Crude Prices  
Physical market prices for benchmark crudes (e.g., Brent, WTI, Dubai), reflecting real-time supply-demand conditions.

---

#### 2.13 Oil: Crude Prices (from 1861)  
Long-term historical crude price series supporting structural and geopolitical analysis.

---

#### 2.14 Oil: Refinery Throughput (from 1980)  
Volume of feedstock processed by refineries.  
Indicates utilization, operational performance, and product supply capability.

---

#### 2.15 Oil: Refining Capacity (from 1965)  
Installed crude distillation capacity of global refineries.  
Essential for long-term refining sector outlooks.

---

#### 2.16 Oil: Regional Refining Margins (from 2000)  
Benchmark refining profitability indicators for major hubs such as:

- U.S. Gulf Coast  
- Northwest Europe (Rotterdam)  
- Singapore  

Margins vary with crude slate, refinery complexity, and regional product prices.

---

#### 2.17 Oil: Trade Movements – Imports  
Cross-border inflows of crude and refined products, relevant for supply security and market balance assessments.

---

#### 2.18 Oil: Trade Movements – Exports  
Cross-border outflows of crude and refined products, indicating production surplus and trade competitiveness.

---

### 3. Refining Margins Methodology

Benchmark refining margins are provided for three global hubs:

- **US Gulf Coast (USGC)**
- **North West Europe (NWE – Rotterdam)**
- **Singapore**

#### 3.1 Crude Slate and Refinery Configuration
Margins are based on:

- A single representative crude oil suitable for each region  
- Optimized product yields based on a **generic refinery configuration**, including:  
  - Cracking  
  - Hydrocracking  
  - Coking  

These configurations reflect typical operational profiles in each refining centre.

---

#### 3.2 Cost Basis
Margins are calculated on a **semi-variable cost basis**, meaning:

> Revenues minus variable costs and fixed energy costs.

This allows comparability across markets by isolating the core refining economics.
