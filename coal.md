### Definition of Total Proved Coal Reserves
Total proved coal reserves are generally defined as:

> Quantities of coal that geological and engineering information indicates with reasonable certainty can be recovered in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.

Important clarifications:

- The data series for total proved coal reserves **does not necessarily conform** to the definitions, guidelines, or practices used for determining proved reserves at the company level (e.g., those of the **U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission**).
- The figures do **not necessarily represent the Energy Institute’s (EI)** own assessment of proved reserves for each country.

### Reserves-to-Production (R/P) Ratio
The **R/P ratio** is defined as:

> **R/P Ratio = Reserves at year-end ÷ Production during that year**

This indicates the number of years remaining reserves would last **if production continues at the current rate**.

Additional notes:

- The R/P ratio calculations **exclude other solid fuels** from both reserves and production datasets.
- **Shares of total** and **R/P ratios** are calculated using **million tonnes** as the unit of measure.

# Anthracite, Bituminous, Sub-bituminous, and Lignite  

## Anthracite
- **Mining perspective:** The hardest and highest-rank coal with very high carbon content (85–95%) and very low moisture. Burns hot and clean with a distinctive blue flame.  
- **Trading perspective:** A premium product used mainly in **metallurgical processes** and specialized industrial heat applications. Limited supply makes it one of the highest-priced coals.

---

## Bituminous
- **Mining perspective:** Dense, black, high-energy coal with lower moisture and higher carbon than sub-bituminous types.  
- **Trading perspective:** The most widely traded coal grade. Used in **power generation** and in **steelmaking** when classified as coking coal. Pricing depends on sulfur, ash, and whether it is thermal or metallurgical.

---

## Sub-bituminous
- **Mining perspective:** Softer coal with higher moisture and lower carbon content than bituminous. Typically abundant and extracted via surface mining.  
- **Trading perspective:** Primarily used in **regional or domestic power generation**. Lower energy density leads to lower pricing and higher transport sensitivity.

---

## Lignite (Brown Coal)
- **Mining perspective:** The lowest-rank coal with very high moisture (up to 60%), low carbon content, and low heating value. Generally consumed close to where it is mined due to poor transport economics.  
- **Trading perspective:** Rarely traded internationally. Mostly burned in **mine-mouth power plants**, with limited commercial value in the global coal market.
